Hello fellow solo travelers,

China opened its visa regime this year, allowing citizens of a couple of European countries to enter visa-free for 14 days. I'm a citizen of one of these countries and want to use it.

14 days is not much for such a big country as China - so, what do you think about my (rough) itinerary?
Who was in China and can report from their experience and let us first-timers benefit from your experience?

All travel blogs and example itineraries claim that Beijing should be the first stop.
I'm thinking about 5-6 days in Beijing, exploring the hallmarks of Chinese culture (Forbidden City, Mao Mausoleum, experiencing local culture, etc.).

Do you think that a visit to the Great Wall is worth it? Or is it only one of these popular sightseeing spots that everyone knows but in reality is not *that* great?

After Beijing, I thought about going to Xi'an by train for 2-3 days. Not only the Terra Cotta Army might be of historical significance but also other places in the city as it used to be the home of some of the past dynasties.

The last stop would be Chengdu (also by train and for 2-3 days). I want to visit the Panda Sanctuary and see if Sichuan cuisine is too hot.

I will probably go to Chongqing for the final day because there is an outbound flight route via Shanghai that is not so pricey.

So if you read this far. What do you think about the theme of my itinerary? I have recent history and current culture (Beijing), really old history (Xi'an), and two things the country is famous for (Pandas and Sichuan food in Chengdu). I will probably have to shave off a day here and there, maybe less time in Beijing.

So, what's your verdict?


1-Beijing: Summer palace, T-Square, Great Wall, Mausoleum. Do not leave China without seeing the Great Wall. You have options ranging from touristy to mountain climbing, and everything in-between. I’d suggest the Gubeikou part of the GW if you like climbing. And don’t forget to try Peking Duck!

2-Xi’an: The Xi’an Wall, Terra-cotta Warriors, Muslim Quarter. You can walk or bike the Xi’an Wall (start in the morning). Then head to the Terra-Cotta Warriors. Finish it off at the Muslim Quarter for some of the best food China has to offer.

3-Chengdu & Chongqing: Pandas, Hongya Cave, Wulong Karst Geological Park, Dazu Rock carvings, Leshan Buddha. Start in Chengdu and see the pandas. Also try your luck at hotpot (Good luck). Head to Chongqing and have some Mapo Tofu. See the Hongya Cave at night and ride the metro that goes through a building. Take a train to Wulong and visit see the transformers in Wulong Karst Park. The Leshan Giant Buddha and Dazu Rock Carvings are bonuses if you have time and get to them.

4-Shenzhen: The beaches. You’ll want to take some time to cool off a bit from travel. Shenzhen is a great place to relax and enjoy the beach and sun. Great food, warm weather, just a fun place to be. You may be tempted to visit Guangzhou. DON’T. I went with a group of friends during Covid, was surrounded by police upon exiting the train station, and demanded we show them our passports or (they were armed and not letting us go without complying). A friend of mine went this past August; same thing. Except he was cornered on the street and “walked” to a police station for questioning. I’m a Black American. My friend is a White Australian. We both have valid working visas and have lived in the country since before the pandemic. There’s clearly some foreigner driven thing happening there. I’ve heard this story several times from people of all walks of life. There isn’t much to do there besides party anyway. Stick to Shenzhen and Shenzhen ONLY.

5-Shanghai: not really a necessary but this would be the airport to fly out of to finish off the trip. There’s lots to see and do but nothing Terra-Cotta Warriors or The Great Wall level. Disney is an option if you’re into that.

I’d stick to the ground and see these places via the train to save costs. Each of these cities have foreigners so if you ever need help you can find someone around. You shouldn’t need to spend more than three days in each city. Count one day for travel, check-in, settling down, etc. Chongqing may take longer if you want to see everything I listed.
