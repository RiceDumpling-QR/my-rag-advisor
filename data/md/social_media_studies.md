Here’s my ever-growing, non-specific copy-paste reply, built from my own notes:

Remember, followers are only for your ego. If you’re a business, Would you rather have a million followers who never buy anything or 1000 followers who purchase everything? (Read Kevin Kelly’s 1000 true fans article). However, if you’re trying to build an account for a brand or human deals, you need as many as possible. I.e. athletes wanting future deals/contracts, actresses wanting future roles, etc
How do you get your first ten followers/sales? ASK. Start with your friends/family/personal socials. “Hey, I've started this thing; I'd love for you to follow”. Then contact everyone you've ever known (see cold outreach later, but this is warm haha). THEN ask them all for referrals: “who do you know that could use my help?”
Your profile description should be a hook/tagline / USP and link to your offer. Remember you’re building your house on rented land if you use socials as your client base. Algorithm changes, and they’re gone. Try sending them off socials to your email list, learn storytelling in email marketing (Russell Brunson has good advice), and you will own that contact for life.
Choose a monetisable niche, find the most successful person in that niche, and put your spin on what they’re doing (ask AI)
Make GOOD content that is visually appealing, entertaining, and has hooks (you have 3 seconds to get attention), but most importantly, ADDS VALUE to your target market (ask AI for suggestions - you can even ask AI to create a customer avatar for you and then ask it how to make good, relevant IG posts for that avatar)
Keep your ears and eyes out for trends. Can you throw a trending song over a clip?
Leverage pop culture. Search for what’s trending daily. Can you combine a movie or album release with your product? For example, if you’re in the auto niche, create an image of a car covered in green slime coinciding with the new Ghostbusters movie
Document your process. Humans evolved on stories & we love to feel part of something and/or have front-row tickets to the show. For example, If you post art, film yourself making the art, not just the final product; talk about your decisions along the way. Also, it is easy content for you, and you’re just filming something you’re already doing
Share as many success stories/testimonials as possible, preferably videos. Tag them. Make it easy for users to share themselves.
In a similar vein, and with permission, share your audience questions in your stories (and tag them)
Remember the rule of 100 (you need to do something 100x before you get “good” at it). Have you posted 100x and made changes as you’ve observed what worked and what didn’t?
Every 5th or so post, add a Call To Action
Always have something to invite people to, such as an event (e.g. Facebook live, face-to-face), a giveaway, a new product, etc. Ensure all your social media banners, popups, CTAs & email sig reflect this (read Book Yourself Solid by Michael Port)
Use the right hashtags (be discoverable)
Post at the correct times for your target market (I like 6-630am so when they wake up and scroll, it’s on their feed, their lunch break and a story at 8 pm in the relevant timezone). Steven Bartlett credits the daily 8pm personal thought post the most important part of his success.
Follow the top 100 people in your niche with between 10k & 100k followers. Engage with them daily. Share their posts. Comment on Their work. As always, be sincere and say something meaningful
Re: cold contacting. Have a framework, but don't automate. Solve their problems. Say something personal (” [mutual person] told me to reach out to you” / “I really like your x” /”congratulations on y”). I noticed that [problem]. Fix their problem. Wish them a nice day. Have an offer in your email signature.
Comment relevant things on important people pages (Gary Vees $1.80 strategy)
Spend $10 a day on ads of targeted content to targeted people (don’t “but I want to grow organically” - Do you want to be seen or not?). Start ad sets at midnight.
Russell Brunson recommends ads are only for offers; posts that aren't offers aren’t to be paid for ads—two separate things. Ads get your customers into the funnel and upsell makes you a profit. Say you sell a $10 ebook and a $300 course. Spend $10 per click for the ebook, so it’s a break-even cost, and everyone who buys the upsell is pure profit. Ad budget for testing is the price/profit of ONE upsell, so $300 in this example. Then, reassess, test and adjust. If it’s working, keep it going, but also test variations regardless. Brendan Kane suggests 50-100 variations from memory. Again, get AI to help. Start with your headline. Ask for ten variations. Then your pic. Get ten variations. Then your hook. Get ten variations etc.
Pay relevant influencers to share your stuff
Read all of Gary Vees and Brendan Kane’s books
Do these things 30-50x a day (Gary Vees' advice for new accounts, search for his eight tips 2024 YT vid) across all your platforms for months, maybe years, and you’ll grow. Perhaps someone famous will share your stuff, and you’ll go viral. But remember, each platform has its nuances, so you need to rework content for it (again, use AI - create one piece and ask AI to brainstorm how to recreate for each platform - you can start with the longest form, say a YouTube vid or blog post and ask it how to make tweets or IG posts from it) however you can still “push”. For example, you can post native Facebook content, but you can also put your YouTube vids and IG posts there
Make at least three posts a day for a month, that's 90 posts, and report back what you learned, what worked and didn’t for everyone else’s benefit. *I've had some pushback on this: A) I don’t make the rules; this seems to be current best practice; B) 1st post = a BTS post of you developing the post, 2nd post = the post, 3rd post = a story summing up your day. OR make all your content in one day and schedule it to post throughout the week. If you don’t have money, you have time; if you have money, outsource it.
Good luck!

Over time, influencer marketing has evolved from celebrity endorsements to include a spectrum of influencers, from mega-influencers with millions of followers to nano-influencers who have a smaller, but highly engaged, audience. This evolution is largely due to the rise of social media platforms, which have democratized content creation and allowed niche personalities to build significant followings around specific interests.

Recent statistics show that the global influencer marketing market was valued at $21.1 billion in 2023, and it is expected to continue growing at an accelerated pace. It is projected to reach $25 billion by 2025, according to Statista. A report by Forbes indicates that 89% of marketers believe the ROI (Return on Investment) from influencer marketing campaigns is comparable or superior to other digital marketing strategies. Moreover, a study by Influencer Marketing Hub reveals that 67% of marketers plan to increase their budgets for influencer marketing in 2025, demonstrating the continued growth of this marketing approach.

Different types of influencer marketing campaigns include:

Sponsored content: Influencers create content that features the brand’s product or service.
Product reviews: Influencers provide their honest review of a product or service to their audience.
Brand ambassador programs: Long-term partnerships where influencers continuously endorse a brand.
Affiliate marketing: Influencers earn a commission for every sale made through a link they share.
Social media takeovers: Influencers take over a brand’s social media account for a set period (often a day) to engage with the brand’s audience.
Giveaways and contests: Influencers host contests or giveaways in collaboration with the brand to increase engagement and visibility.
Emerging trends show that nano-influencers and micro-influencers are gaining traction as brands seek higher levels of authenticity and engagement. According to Statista, 80% of brands collaborating with micro-influencers report a positive ROI from their campaigns. Additionally, the focus on sustainability and social responsibility is growing. Consumers increasingly value the ethics and sustainability of the brands they support, and influencer campaigns promoting eco-friendly products or social initiatives tend to generate a more positive response.
